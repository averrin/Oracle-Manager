# Oracle Manager

Please visit [Releases page](https://github.com/averrin/Oracle-Manager/releases) for downloads.

This tool can help you to organize your oracles during a (solo) roleplaying game. It provides simple "roll table" oracles and basic organizational features.

You can edit `sources.json` to add your random source (e.g. dices) and add your oracles to the `oracles` folder. There is no documentation yet, but you can use existing files as an example.
